                Do you remember how nervous we both were? How our first hug felt both strange and completely familiar at the same time? It's incredible to think how that one meeting at Centris Station set everything else in motion. From messages on screens to standing face-to-face.

My heart was pounding so hard I was sure you could hear it. And that thoughtful gift you gave me in the car... I still treasure it.
                <br><br>
                Walking through those shops together, stealing glances, our hands brushing against each other before finally intertwining. Everything felt new and exciting, yet somehow it also felt like coming home. The way you looked at me that day... I knew then that what we had was something rare and beautiful.
                <br><br>
                Our first date is indeed the beginning of so many wonderful moments. Thank you for making that day one I'll cherish forever.

                I remember watching you fall asleep, how peaceful you looked, and feeling this overwhelming sense of trust and connection. And waking up to see your face first thing in the morning - that morning smile and kiss you gave me - it felt like a glimpse into our future.
                <br><br>
                That night was about more than just staying over, It was the first time I felt like I could truly be myself with you, and it made me fall for you even more.

                You remembered our precious staycation! Those four days that somehow felt both endless and fleeting all at once. How we tried to slow down time, knowing the clock was ticking toward our goodbye.
                <br><br>
                That bittersweet dance between joy and the looming separation taught us something beautiful - that even knowing heartache was coming, we chose love anyway. We chose to dive into happiness, to create moments worth missing each other for.
                <br><br>
                I've replayed those staycation days in my mind so many times during our time apart. They've been a reminder of what we're working toward, of why the distance is worth it. Because what we have is rare and worth every mile between us.

                You've completed some of our journey through the milestones of our first year together! Look at how far we've come - from that first nervous meeting at Centris Station to building a love that grows stronger with each passing day, despite the distance and challenges.
                <br><br>
                This past year has been the most beautiful chapter of my life. Every moment with you - whether in person or across the miles - has filled my heart in ways I never thought possible. You've shown me what it means to truly be seen and loved for exactly who I am.
                <br><br>
                Each memory we've revisited today represents a building block of us - the foundation of something extraordinary that we're creating together. I cherish every laugh, every tear, every conversation, every touch, and even every goodbye, because they're all part of our story.
                <br><br>
                Thank you for being my partner, my source of strenght, my greatest adventure. Happy Anniversary, my baby. Now for your final surprise...

                    Happy Anniversary, Baby!
                    Time flies but here we are marking the first anniversary of our relationship, no matter how far we are. Despite all the challenges, our ups and downs, we've shown how dedicated and strong our relationship is.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm really grateful to have you, baby! You've become one of my motivations and source of strength to continue being a better person/partner every day. Since the day that you came into my life, everything seems so light. I know that there're still some challenges that are undeniably impossible to overcome, but with you, it feels so much more bearable. I can't even explain how safe I feel whenever I'm with you—my mind's at peace.
                    <br>
                    Every moment we've made, no matter how simple or short is that, it will forever stays with me. From the unexpected laughs to the quiet moments, they’ve all built something beautiful between us. Even if we're hundred miles away right now, my heart's right there with you, just like it always will be. I can’t wait for the day we no longer have to count the distance—only the moments we’re together
                    <br><br>
                    I love you so much, baby! See you soon.
